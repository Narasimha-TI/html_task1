    <p style="text-transform:capitalize; font-size: 25px;font-family:sans-serif;color: rgb(15, 15, 15);">anacondas are native to the northern regions of South America. They are most abundant in the Orinoco basin in Columbia, the Amazon River basin in Brazil, and the flooded Llanos grasslands in Venezuela. They are also found in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Paraguay, French Guiana, and Trinidad.</p>

    <p style="text-transform:capitalize; font-size: 25px;font-family:sans-serif;color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Their venom is not the most potent among venomous snakes, but the amount of neurotoxin they can deliver in a single bite—up to two-tenths of a fluid ounce—is enough to kill 20 people, or even an elephant. King cobra venom affects the respiratory centers in the brain, causing respiratory arrest and cardiac failure.

   <p style="text-transform:capitalize; font-size: 25px;font-family:sans-serif;color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Rattlesnakes are not aggressive and will not attack humans if unprovoked; in fact, they are quite shy and timid. However, they are venomous and can be dangerous if molested or handled. With improved methods of treatment and the abandonment of folk cures (many of which presented more danger than benefit to the victim), a rattlesnake bite is no longer the threat to life that it once was, but medical assessment should always be sought after any bite. A rattlesnake bite is very painful, and that of a snake more than 1 metre (3.3 feet) long can be fatal. The snake should be killed and brought in for identification, even for “dry” bites, in which venom is not injected. A person with a “dry” bite should not be treated with antivenin because many people are allergic to the horse serum used in its production. </p>
