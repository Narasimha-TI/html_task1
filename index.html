            <p class="first">anacondas are native to the northern regions of South America. They are most abundant in
                the Orinoco basin in Columbia, the Amazon River basin in Brazil, and the flooded Llanos grasslands in
                Venezuela. They are also found in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Paraguay, French Guiana, and Trinidad.

        <p class="second">Their venom is not the most potent among venomous snakes, but the amount of neurotoxin they
            can deliver in a single bite—up to two-tenths of a fluid ounce—is enough to kill 20 people, or even an
            elephant. King cobra venom affects the respiratory centers in the brain, causing respiratory arrest and
            cardiac failure.

                <p class="third">Rattlesnakes are not aggressive and will not attack humans if unprovoked; in fact, they are
                    quite shy and timid. However, they are venomous and can be dangerous if molested or handled. With improved
                    methods of treatment and the abandonment of folk cures (many of which presented more danger than benefit to
                    the victim).</p>

                <p class="fourth">The snake venom of Echis species consists mostly of four types of toxins: neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, hemotoxins, and cytotoxins. The genus is recognized as medically significant in many tropical rural areas. They are widespread and live in areas lacking modern medical facilities. Most victims are bitten after dark when these snakes are active. </p>
